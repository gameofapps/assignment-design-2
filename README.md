Thank you for your application to Game of Apps for a summer design internship! The following are instructions for the take-home questions that we want you to work through and answer as part of your interview and evaluation process. You have until **June 9, 2021 at 5PM PST/2PM EST** to complete the take-home questions.

## Design

### Activity 1: Visual Literacy

Pick a colour and create 5 unique images based on the colour. The images may be a set of photos, paintings or illustrations, and may be digital or in printed/physical form. You have to be the creator of these images. Explain your choice of colour, what it connotes, how the 5 images work together as a series, and your process in this exercise.

Please copy, scan, or take a photo of your images into a Figma or Miro project for your submission.

### Activity 2: Typography

Pick a letter in the English language alphabet and create a set of 20 unique thumbnail size images (600px x 400px or print equivalent) that can creatively express the given letter. The imagery may be black and white or colour, and may be on any medium you wish. Explain the concept of each thumbnail and how you've tried to communicate that concept.

Please opy, scan, or take a photo of your images into a Figma or Miro project for your submission.

### Activity 3: Critical Thinking

Write an essay between 500â€“600 words discussing the impact on customer behaviour as technology overtakes traditional businesses. For example: Online shopping taking over physical malls, self driving cars taking over truckers business.

## Submission
